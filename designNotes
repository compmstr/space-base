Damage:
  Damagable component -- has HP
  DamageReduction component -- Has map of <type> -> [[<id> <amt>]...]
    <id> is entity that added damage reduction (main entity id is base reduction)
  Damage System looks at base damage being done, looks for DamageReduction
    component to modify that damage

Locomotion:
  Terrain tiles have different speed modifiers, that can be modified
    by locomotion components
  Locomotion Component -- has list of movement modes
    Movement modes: has base speed
	  Walking - default terrain modifier 1x
	  Crawling - default terrain modifier 2x
	  Flying - default windspeed modifier 1x
	  ...

Tasks:
  Each entity can have component tasks (hunger, fatigue, etc)
  Each entity can have a faction, which can filter tasks
  Both priority and distance affect selection of tasks
    (ex, lower priority task that is much closer than higher priority
	  will get done first)
  Can mark tasks with urgent levels (default in middle) to get them done faster

Skills:
  Skills can have time/damage/accuracy modifiers for different actions
    Will need to tie skills in with a lot of systems
  
Equipment:
  Can modifier different actions/components
    ex: Armor adding/removing DamageReduction when equipped/unequipped
  Provide different methods of performing tasks
    ex: Laser mining vs explosive mining
